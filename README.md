# About me:

I'm a software engineer / Full-stack developer,  which started his career in coding at the beginning of February 2020. 

I have been enjoying the liberty and freedom that software development brings into my life, being able to create anything I can come to mind, Of course, the knowledge might not be there at the start of the project but with passion and good learning techniques anything it's possible.

I'm open to help and collaborate in an open-source project as you might have seen some of my projects are aimed towards making life easier for those having disadvantages.

The project I'm most proud of it's Helping Hand! go and check it out at my portfolio! Our team formed part of the European [COVID-19](https://euvsvirus.org/) hackathon to help people that weren't available to perform a daily task, like shopping in the times of the Corona Pandemic.
